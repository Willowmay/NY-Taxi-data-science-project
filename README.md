## What I have included in this project:

1. Explore Data Analysis

2. Display a scatter plot of pickup locations Matplotlib scatter function makes a scatter plot of x vs y, where x and y are sequence like objects of the same length. 

Also I have customized the plot to:
- Make markers smaller
- Make fewer points by making some points transparent
- Zoom in around Manhattan
- Make figure bigger
- Don't display the axes

3. Find out for which vendor is it easiest to find a cab?

4. Display a histogram of the trip distances.

5. Filtering with boolean indexing in order to select long rides
